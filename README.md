# School Meal Planner

###### An app that tells you which school lunches are best for YOU

## The Reason for Existence
The reason I created this project was so I could choose the best lunch for myself for the whole week. Only works for my school right now

## Features:
- Uses Streamlit for the UI
- Uses python(obviously)
- Uses Hack Club AI for quick inference!
- Uses the unofficial NutriSlice API for my school

# Prerequisites
- Have an API key from ai.hackclub.com
- Have a brain

## Usage:
### Streamlit(recommended)
- Clone the repo
- Make a folder called `.streamlit` and make the file `secrets.toml` there
- Set the variable `API_KEY` to whatever Hack Club AI api key you have
- Warning! Any other API key WILL NOT WORK
- Run `streamlit run app.py`
- Boom! It's running! Have fun!
